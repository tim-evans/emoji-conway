## ✌️ Conway's Game of Life

A client / server Conway game of life.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running

To run the app, run `npm start` and `npx parcel index.html`. Visit [`localhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234) (or whatever parcel starts on) to see it in action ❤️

## 👩‍💻 Developing

This app is built using Parcel! I've bundled the package with the app, so all you'll need to do is run:

```bash
npm install
```

Once all the dependencies are installed, the app can be run by running `npx parcel index.html`.

The server is run by executing `npm start`. Once these two pieces are up and running, you can run the app in development mode.

## 🏗 Building

The frontend portion of the app can be built for production using this command:

```bash
npx parcel build
```

This should build the app under the `dist/` directory in the root of the project.
